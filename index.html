        <h2>Bear Lake</h2><br>
        <p>I spent one week in Utah with my mom's side of the family. Our family has a yearly tradition of visiting Bear Lake in northern Utah, and spending time together. We rented a large cabin that could fit around 50 people, and would hang out there for breakfast and after the beach. At the cabin, we would play card games, play phone games, and talk. When the evening came around, the individual families would go into the small town to get ice cream and hang out. At the beach, our family would rent Wave Runners, rent Water trampolines, and play in the water.</p>
